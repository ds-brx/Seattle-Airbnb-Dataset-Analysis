# First Data Science Project
Seattle Airbnb Data - Data Analysis

Libraries used :
Numpy, Pandas, SciKit learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Motivation : 
Renting or finding accomodation is one the most common problems faced during travel. This project explores a beginner level approach to analysing the main factors determining the prices of accomadations, based on property types, amenities and locality. This will give an insight into efficiently setting cost, thereby saving money, and getting better review scores on listings.

Files in Repository : 
Listings.csv from Seattle Airbnb Dataset, my.ipynb, and 3 graphs.

Summary of Analysis : 
Average prices of Condominium property types are the higest and they gradually decrease from Houses and Lofts to Apartments and other types. Pricing is mainly influenced by number of bedrooms,bathrooms and number of amenities. Random Forest REgresson is used to predict prices of unknown propert types based on the important features concluded from correlations heatmap.
