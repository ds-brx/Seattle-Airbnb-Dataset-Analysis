# First Data Science Project
Seattle Airbnb Data - Data Analysis

Libraries used :
Numpy, Pandas, SciKit learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Motivation : 
Renting or finding accomodation is one the most common problems faced during travel. This project explores a beginner level approach to analysing the main factors determining the prices of accomadations, based on property types, amenities and locality. This will give an insight into efficiently setting cost, thereby saving money, and getting better review scores on listings.

Files in Repository : 
Listings.csv from Seattle Airbnb Dataset, my.ipynb, and 3 graphs.

Summary of Analysis : 
Condominium property types are the most costly and the prices gradually decrease from houses,lofts to apartments and other types. 
From the correlations graph, the prices of accomodations mostly depend upon number of accomodates,bathrooms,bedrooms.
On predicting prices by using random forest regressors, most important features influencing the pricing of accomodations are bedrooms,bathrooms,room_types,availibility in a year,and amenities.
